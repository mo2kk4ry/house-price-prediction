# Project Title: House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Type: Guided Learning Project

## Overview:
This project involved building a supervised machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, presence of amenities (like a basement, guestroom, or hot water heating), and furnishing status. The project was conducted under the guidance of a mentor as part of my hands-on learning in applied machine learning.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains structured data of housing features, including:

Numerical variables: price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking

Categorical variables: main_road, guestroom, basement, hot_water_heating, air_conditioning, furnishing_status, pref_area

## Objectives:

Apply preprocessing techniques for handling categorical and numerical data.

Build and evaluate a regression model for price prediction.

Understand feature importance and model interpretability.

Tools and Technologies:

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

## Key Takeaways:

Learned how to structure a machine learning pipeline from raw data to model prediction.

Gained practical experience with data preprocessing, encoding categorical variables, and model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

Understood how different housing features affect property prices.

## My Role:

Participated in data analysis and feature engineering

Assisted in training and testing the regression model

Analyzed model results and visualized predictions

Documented the process and outcomes for learning purposes
