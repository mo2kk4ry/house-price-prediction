# Project Title: 🏠 House Price Prediction Model

## Overview:
This project involved building a supervised machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, presence of amenities (like a basement, guestroom, or hot water heating), and furnishing status. 
> 📚 This was a **guided learning project** developed under the mentorship of an experienced data scientist. I actively contributed to the data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training and evaluation, and learned the end-to-end ML workflow through practical implementation.

**Models Tried**:
We tested several classification algorithms from Scikit-learn to compare their performance:

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
- Gaussian Naive Bayes  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier ✅ (best-performing)

**Final Model**:  
✅ **Random Forest Classifier** – Chosen based on its high accuracy and robustness in handling both numerical and categorical features.
